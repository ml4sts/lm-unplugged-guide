# Preparation Guide 


1. [Purchase Materials](#setup:detail:materials)
1. Choose a [timing](#setup:detail:timing) and [venue](#setup:detail:venue)
1. Set a date and promote
1. Prepare materials before a workshop
1. Set up before attendees arrive

## Timing

<!-- TODO(@sarah)  get exports from planning spreadsheet -->


(setup:detail:venue)=
## Venue Requirements and Considerations 

requirements: 
- sound system proportionate to the audience size
- table to hold bins
- place to put the poster boards


tips: 
- a long table or a short table + a chalkboard/whiteboard ledge works well
- make sure the items can be high enough for the audience to see

(setup:detail:materials)=
## Material List 

- at least 8, better 20+ bins large enough to hold up to ~30 ping pong balls
- ping ping balls in 5 colors
- sticky notes in matching colors to the pingpong balls (enough sets of colors for each group + the facilitator set)
- paper that is in contrast to all 5 colors (1 per person)
- poster boards to post generated documents
- tape 
- (optional) durable bin labels instead of tape





## Advance Material Setup

1. Create material sets to make passing out paper and stickies easier 
1. Pre-label bins if possible


(setup:detail:dayof)=
## Setup


1. Label 2 sets of 4 bins
1. Set up a pretrained model, aim for 20-40% end-of-document (white, here) balls
